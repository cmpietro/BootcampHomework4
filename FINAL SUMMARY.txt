A simple describe of the data shows that the minimum age of seven and a maximum age of 45, as well as the minimum price of $1.00 and a maximum price of $4.99.  The total number of unique players, 576 and a total of 780 purchases, is small total for the game considering The Sims 3 had a total of 7.95 million units sold as of January 2018.  It is valuable to note that of the 576 players 484 were male and only 81 were female, an 84% male to 14% female ratio.  Current gamer statistics (2018) showed the percentages of male to female players much closer, with 45% of players being female and 55% male, as a part of the whole.

The total purchase value of the male versus female for Pymoli showed that the male purchaser may have added more value, the female purchaser was willing to spend slighly more, per purchase.

Age related information clearly shows a preference in the 20 - 24 age grouping while the average age of the average gamer in 2018 is actually 34 years of age.  This game clearly shows it is preferred by a younger male audience than that of the world average gamer.
